# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project is part of my data analytics course and focuses on assisting Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company, with launching an online video rental service to stay competitive in the face of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst hired by Rockbuster's business intelligence department, my primary task is to analyze the company's data and provide insights to support the launch strategy.

## Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has outlined several key questions for the 2020 company strategy:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Context

To address these questions, I'll be using SQL to query the data incrementally, starting with basic queries and progressing to more complex analyses. The results will be visualized using Excel for exploration and Canvas and Tableau for presentation purposes.

## Data Set

The data set provided contains information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, and more. This data will be used to derive insights and answer the key questions posed by the management board.

### Tools and Technologies

- PostgreSQL for data storage and querying
- Excel for exploring and visualizing results
- Canvas for presenting findings
- Tableau for data visualization
